    "Mobile first" means you code your website for mobile devices first.
    
    When coding for mobile first sites, your default class will not need any media queries. That's because it is by default styled to fit small devices.
    <p>
    As you move up in screen sizes you'll then need to add media queries so your content better fits those screens.
